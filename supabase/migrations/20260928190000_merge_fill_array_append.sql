-- ============================================================================
-- Merge accounts: the "filled" list could not take a name (2026-09-28).
--
-- staff_merge_customers (20260928130000) records which of the keeper's empty profile fields it
-- filled from the other account in fl text[], one line per field: fl := fl || 'photo'. An untyped
-- literal on the right of || against an array is read by Postgres as an ARRAY literal (anyarray ||
-- anyarray wins over anyarray || anyelement for an unknown), so the first field the keeper lacked
-- ended the merge with `malformed array literal: "photo"` - the owner saw it merging two accounts
-- - and the whole merge rolled back. The five merges that went through were the ones where the
-- keeper lacked nothing (every recorded filled is []). array_append(fl, 'photo') says what was
-- meant. The tag lists were never affected: tg is a declared text variable, so tags_dup || tg
-- resolves as array || element.
--
-- Body rebuilt from the live definition (pg_get_functiondef, 2026-09-28; the live body is
-- 20260928130000's minus its comments) with the ten lines changed and nothing else; attributes kept:
-- SECURITY DEFINER, search_path public. Dry-run against production inside a rolled-back DO block:
-- a keeper without a photo merged with an account that had one returned filled=["photo"], the
-- photo copied, merged_into set, SECURITY DEFINER kept.
--
-- Rollback: re-run the function from 20260928130000 (it brings the fault back with it).
-- Idempotent.
